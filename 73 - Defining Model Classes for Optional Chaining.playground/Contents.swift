//Linking Multiple Levels of Chaining
/*
 You can link together multiple levels of optional chaining to drill down to properties, methods, and subscripts deeper within a model. However, multiple levels of optional chaining don’t add more levels of optionality to the returned value.
 To put it another way:
 If the type you are trying to retrieve isn’t optional, it will become optional because of the optional chaining.
 If the type you are trying to retrieve is already optional, it will not become more optional because of the chaining.
 Therefore:
 If you try to retrieve an Int value through optional chaining, an Int? is always returned, no matter how many levels of chaining are used.
 Similarly, if you try to retrieve an Int? value through optional chaining, an Int? is always returned, no matter how many levels of chaining are used.
 The example below tries to access the street property of the address property of the residence property of john. There are two levels of optional chaining in use here, to chain through the residence and address properties, both of which are of optional type:
