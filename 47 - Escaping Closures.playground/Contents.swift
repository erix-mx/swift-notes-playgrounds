//Escaping Closures
/*
 A closure is said to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument to the function, but is called after the function returns. When you declare a function that takes a closure as one of its parameters, you can write @escaping before the parameterâ€™s type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape.
